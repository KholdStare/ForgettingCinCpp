Outline of main points of presentation.

- History of C++

- Outline of compilation model for C and then C++
    + compilation/translation units
    + preprocessor          -> resolves includes/defines
    + compiler/assembler    -> compiles translation unit to object file
    + linker                -> links all object file into single executable

- Things to watch out for in C++
    - Some features do not jive with C-like programming
    - inheritance
    - exceptions

- Avoid #define constants
    - Carries no type information
    + Use const globals instead (note about const correctness)

- Avoid macros
    - Source of constant not visible to compiler leading to errors in obscure location which you then need to trace back to the macro
    - Copy-pastes arguments as texts.
    - Bracketing problems. Very tricky
    - Can create undefined behaviour or unintentional behaviour as a result
    + Use inline function if performance is a concern 
    - What about generality? The same macro can be reused for different types (Can we live with drawbacks just for this?)
    + No need to, use template functions!

- Declare variables when needed
    - Declaring everything in the kitchen sink at beginning of scope was required in C
    - If function is large, it is often tedious to keep track of the mess. Unused variables?
    + In C99 and C++ variables can and should be declared when needed, as it helps the compiler to optimize code based on usage.

- Prefer references over pointers
    + Cannot be null (~ish), so less null-checks (perhaps give example of how it is passed down?)
    + non-reassignable
    - use pointers where results null object is a valid option, and need re-assignability
    + & for arguments that are expected to be changed, const& for everything else
    + (mention better/tighter specification, helps programmers, avoids bugs)

- Use STL ( mention at end of first talk )

- Classes overview
    + members
    + methods
    + constructors
    + destructor (very important)
    + allocation on stack
    + allocation on heap through new/delete, allows polymorphism

- Use initializer lists in constructors (don't forget copy constructors!)

- Copy constructors
    - if class has pointers, default constructor will blindly copy the pointer, not the contents

- Use RAII
    + through use of destructors
    + smart pointer example (new delete), with exceptions

- Casting 
    - refrain from using the C-style bracket cast
    - Very hard to see and search for in code
    - Less control and safety
    + Use one of static_cast, dynamic_cast or reinterpret_cast (also there is const_cast)

- Follow const-correctness

- Use STL ( go into detail )
